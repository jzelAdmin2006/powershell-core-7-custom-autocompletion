# History-based autocompletion for PowerShell with tab

Place the profile.ps1 script into the following location:

- Windows - $PSHOME\Profile.ps1
- Linux - /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/profile.ps1
- macOS - /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/7/profile.ps1

File-based autocompletion can still be used with `CTRL`+`SPACE`.
